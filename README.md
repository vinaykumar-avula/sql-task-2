## ðŸ“‚ What I Did

- Created a table named *Employees* with the following columns:

  - Department
  - Salary
  - Email
  - ManagerID
  - JoinDate

- *Inserted data* into the table, including:
  - Full rows with complete data.
  - Rows with NULL values to test NULL handling.
  - Rows with only specific columns inserted (partial insert).

- *Updated data*:
  - Updated salary for an employee with NULL salary.
  - Set the ManagerID to NULL for an employee.

  - Deleted records where the Email column was NULL.


## âœ… Outcome

A populated database with clean, consistent data and a clear understanding of NULL handling and data manipulation in SQL.
